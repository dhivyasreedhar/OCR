# OCR
OCR = Optical Character Recognition. In other words, OCR systems transform a two-dimensional image of text, that could contain machine printed or handwritten text from its image representation into machine-readable text.
Pytesseract or Python-tesseract is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool for python. It will read and recognize the text in images, license plates, etc. Here, we will use the tesseract package to read the text from the given image.
